<h2>MKDIR(1)                  BSD General Commands Manual                 MKDIR(1)</h2>
<hr/>

<b><u>NAME</b></u>
     <p>mkdir -- make directories</p>

<b><u>SYNOPSIS</b></u>
     <p>mkdir [-pv] [-m mode] directory_name ...</p>

<b><u>DESCRIPTION</b></u>
     <p>The mkdir utility creates the directories named as operands, in the order specified, using mode
     rwxrwxrwx (0777) as modified by the current umask(2).</p>

     The options are as follows:

     -m mode
             Set the file permission bits of the final created directory to the specified mode.  The mode
             argument can be in any of the formats specified to the chmod(1) command.  If a symbolic mode is
             specified, the operation characters ``+'' and ``-'' are interpreted relative to an initial mode
             of ``a=rwx''.

     -p      Create intermediate directories as required.  If this option is not specified, the full path
             prefix of each operand must already exist.  On the other hand, with this option specified, no
             error will be reported if a directory given as an operand already exists.  Intermediate direc-tories directories
             tories are created with permission bits of rwxrwxrwx (0777) as modified by the current umask,
             plus write and search permission for the owner.

     -v      Be verbose when creating directories, listing them as they are created.

     The user must have write permission in the parent directory.</p>

<b><u>DIAGNOSTICS</b></u>
     <p>The mkdir utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.</p>

<b><u>SEE ALSO</b></u>
     <p>rmdir(1)</p>

<b><u>COMPATIBILITY</b></u>
     <p>The -v option is non-standard and its use in scripts is not recommended.</p>

<b><u>STANDARDS</b></u>
     <p>The mkdir utility is expected to be IEEE Std 1003.2 (``POSIX.2'') compatible.</p>

<b><u>HISTORY</b></u>
     <p>A mkdir command appeared in Version 1 AT&T UNIX.</p>

<p>BSD                            January 25, 1994                            BSD</p>
